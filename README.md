Context analysis based Automation of Student debarring System 

Students must document their leave of absence for not attending classes for a specific period where they are required to provide appropriate and genuine reasoning for the same. These applications need to be passed through an automated system that determines whether they are genuine and marks their attendance accordingly.

The disadvantage of the current automated system is that it only considers the content typed by the student as a reason for not attending the class and not the context of it. This method of examining student responses might overlook a genuine reason why a student was not attending the class, and marking them absent might eventually lead to them getting debarred from attending examinations. Thus, it does not give a clear idea of the reasoning as to why the said student is not attending class.

Text analysis is a machine learning technique used to automatically derive insights from unstructured data. This research proposes using text analytics to contextualize the student debarring system. To achieve this, we are employing the use of the bag of words module and the NLTK library present in python to develop a custom dictionary of keywords about valid reasons for attending classes.
